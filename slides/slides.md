Outline for today:
+ What does it mean to have **faith** in Christ?
+ Are we **holy / righteous** in God's sight?
+ What are the **sacraments**?
  + holy (set aside, special) rituals
  + **symbolic** meaning

---
These have been written so that you may **believe** <br/>
that Jesus is the **Christ**, the **Son of God**; <br/>
and that believing you may have **life** in His name.

<div class="ref">
John 20:31 (NASB)
</div>

>>>
+ **purpose** why John recorded gospel:
  + **believe** (faith) in Jesus:
    + is the **Christ**
    + is the Son of **God**
  + have **life** in Him (regeneration)
+ so what does **faith** entail?

---
Q.125: What does **true faith** imply?

A: Real **repentance** and **sorrow** for sin: <br/>
that we become **convinced** of our sinfulness, <br/>
and **repent** thereof.

>>>
+ **repentance**:
+ recognize we are utterly **lost** without Christ
+ **turn**: change of heart

---
**Cast away** from you all the **transgressions** <br/>
that you have committed, <br/>
and make yourselves a **new heart** and a **new spirit**!

**Why** will you die, O house of Israel? <br/>
For I have **no pleasure** in the death of anyone, <br/>
declares the Lord God; so **turn**, and **live**.

<div class="ref">
Ezekiel 18:31-32 (ESV)
</div>

>>>
+ God **desires** that all may be saved
+ but we must **turn**:
  + **away** from sin + selfishness
  + **toward** God
+ **new heart**:

---
But when the **goodness** and **loving kindness** <br/>
of God our **Savior** appeared, he **saved** us,

not because of **works** done by us in righteousness,  <br/>
but according to his own **mercy**,

by the washing of **regeneration** <br/>
and **renewal** of the Holy Spirit

<div class="ref">
Titus 3:4-5 (ESV)
</div>

>>>
+ regeneration: born again (Nicodemus)

---
Now faith is the **substance** of things **hoped** for, <br/>
the **evidence** of things **not seen**.

By faith **Abel**, ... **Enoch**, ... **Noah**, ...

<div class="ref">
Hebrews 11:1 (KJV)
</div>

>>>
+ "substance" (ὑπόστασις): support
  + NAS/ESV: assurance
  + NIV: confidence

We beg you on behalf of Christ, be **reconciled** to God.

He made Him who knew **no sin** <br/>
to **be sin** on our behalf, <br/>
so that we might become the **righteousness of God** in Him.

<div class="ref">
2 Corinthians 5:20-21 (NASB)

But now that you have been set **free from sin** <br/>
and have become **slaves of God**,

the **fruit** you get leads to **sanctification** <br/>
and its end, **eternal life**.

<div class="ref">
Romans 6:22 (ESV)

As **obedient** children, do not be conformed  <br/>

but as he who **called** you is holy,  <br/>
you also **be holy** in all your conduct

<div class="ref">

**called** to be saints together

with all those who in **every place**  <br/>
**call** upon the name of our Lord **Jesus Christ**,  <br/>

**stir** up one another to **love** and **good works**,

not neglecting to **meet together**, as is the habit of some,  <br/>

Go therefore and **make disciples** of all nations,

and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

**teaching** them to observe all that I have commanded you.

Q.146: What is the **purpose** of baptism?

A: It **identifies** the believer with his Lord.
+ It is also an **ordinance** of Christ
  serving as a sign
  + of being spiritually **born** of God,
  + of **putting on** Christ,
  + and of being **united** with the Church.
+ It is the evidence of a **covenant** with Christ.

---
We were **buried** therefore with him by **baptism** into death, <br/>
in order that, just as Christ was **raised** from the dead  <br/>
by the glory of the Father,  <br/>
we too might walk in **newness of life**.

For if we have been **united** with him in a **death** like his, <br/>
we shall certainly be united with him  <br/>
in a **resurrection** like his.

When He had given thanks, He broke it and said, <br/>
“This is My **body**, which is for you; <br/>
do this in **remembrance** of Me.”

In the same way He took the **cup** also after supper, <br/>
saying, “This cup is the **new covenant** in My blood; <br/>
do this, as often as you drink it,
in **remembrance** of Me.”

<div class="ref">

Let a person **examine himself**, then,
and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.

For anyone who eats and drinks without **discerning the body**
eats and drinks **judgment** on himself

<div class="ref">
1 Corinthians 11:28-29 (ESV)

For **by grace** you have been saved **through faith**.

And this is not your **own doing**; it is the **gift of God**, <br/>
not a result of **works**, so that no one may **boast**

For we are his **workmanship**, created in Christ Jesus for **good works**, <br/>
which God prepared beforehand, that we should **walk** in them.

<div class="ref">
Ephesians 2:8-10 (ESV)

+ Our response is to **trust** Him
  + repentance, belief, life
+ God **formed** us for good **works**
  + not **passive** enjoyment
