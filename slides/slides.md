Q.125: What does **true faith** imply?

A: Real **repentance** and **sorrow** for sin: <br/>

**Cast away** from you all the **transgressions** <br/>
that you have committed, <br/>
and make yourselves a **new heart** and a **new spirit**!

**Why** will you die, O house of Israel? <br/>
For I have **no pleasure** in the death of anyone, <br/>
declares the Lord God; so **turn**, and **live**.

<div class="ref">
Ezekiel 18:31-32 (ESV)
</div>

>>>
+ God **desires** that all may be saved
+ but we must **turn**:
  + **away** from sin + selfishness
  + **toward** God
+ **new heart**: 

---
But when the **goodness** and **loving kindness** <br/>
of God our **Savior** appeared, he **saved** us,

not because of **works** done by us in righteousness,  <br/>
but according to his own **mercy**,

by the washing of **regeneration** <br/>
and **renewal** of the Holy Spirit

<div class="ref">
Titus 3:4-5 (ESV)
</div>

>>>
+ regeneration: born again (Nicodemus)
